🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
Will they survive or not? Let's find out!


Goal: Predict passenger survival using logistic regression.

📌 Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
Using data from actual passengers, this project builds a Logistic Regression model to predict who survived the tragedy based on features like age, gender, class, and more.

🧠 What You’ll Learn
📊 How to clean and prepare real-world data

📈 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔢 Apply Logistic Regression for binary classification

📉 Evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

🧪 Interpret logistic regression coefficients

🔍 Dataset Overview
